### ðŸ“ŒREQUIREMENTS :
- python 3
- tkinter module
- from tkinter messagebox module
- pyautogui

****

### ðŸ“ŒHow this Script works :
- User just need to download the file and run the mouse_pointer_co-ordinates_getter.py on their local system.
- Now the main window of the application opens and user can move the mouse and will get the co-ordinates of each instant position of his/her mouse pointer on the screen.
- Also user can use this application to find the height and width of his/her screen of PC/computer.
- Also there is an exit button, clicking on which exit dialog box appears asking for the permission of the user for closing the window.

### ðŸ“ŒPurpose :
- This scripts helps us to easily get the instant position of mouse pointer on the screen.

### ðŸ“ŒCompilation Steps :
- Install tkinter, pyautogui
- After that download the code file, and run mouse_pointer_co-ordinates_getter.py on local system.
- Then the script will start running and get the co-ordinates as mentioned.
